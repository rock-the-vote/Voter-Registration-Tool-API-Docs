# Overview

Rocky is web application that provides a web user interface that U.S. citizens can use for assistance in preparing a voter registration application document that is complete and correct for all Federal and state­ specific requirements, and therefore should be accepted in most cases by the election officials to whom the user submits the completed, printed, signed form.

This specification defines an application programming interface that provides exactly the same functions as the Rocky web UI, but intended for a complementary purpose: use by other web applications that have or collect personal info via their own web UI, and which rely on the Rocky back­end for data validation, error reporting (particularly for state­ specific conditions), PDF generation, and data storage. Via this API, Rocky provides a web service to service clients (web applications that use this API to interact with Rocky) that are software operated by Rocky "partner organizations".

Partner organizations also have access to aggregated data and reporting. These are provided by the Rocky Web UI in two ways partner organization staff can use to obtain statistics and summary information: a CSV file download provides aggregated registration data for all the registrations done via that partner; and a summary web page provides statistics about this partner­specific aggregated data set. This API provides analogous bulk data extraction, with the "partner_registrations" interface that returns the same data as is provided in the web UI CSV file download.

The primary interface is this API is the "registrations" interface, in which callers provide all the personal data needed to create a person’s voter registration application form. Rocky checks the validity of each field, including state­ specific validation rules. If there are errors, Rocky returns to the caller a set of error reporting on individual fields of personal data. If there are no errors, Rocky returns the URL of a PDF file that contains the validated information, properly formatted as a voter registration request form.

This API also includes an optional interface "state_requirements," used to pre­check the user data based on location and date of birth. One intended use of the pre­check function is for cases where service clients that already know the user’s location, and perhaps also DOB. In such cases, the service client can find out from Rocky whether a user is ineligible, and if so, not even begin the web UI dialogues with the user to obtain personal information. Location ineligibility is the result of states that do not allow voter registration by mail, or do not accept Rocky­generated forms for some other reason. DOB is used to determine age ineligibility in the user’s state.

When the user is not ineligible based on location or DOB, "state_requirements" returns several kinds of state­ specific information that the caller could use as part its web UI with the user ­­ for example, the list of political parties that user can select for affiliation, or an indication that certain fields are optional for the state, or not collected by the state.

Finally, the API includes the "partner_registrations" interface to obtain records of past registration transactions. Like the similar UI in the Rocky Partner Portal, access requires authentication, and the records returned are only those pertinent to the authenticated entity.

# Release Notes

## V4

The registration submission endpoint (/api/v4/registrations and /api/v4/gregistrations) will now return a validation error if the email address submitted is in our block list.

### Removed 

* `GET /api/v4/registrations`  
* `GET /api/v4/gregistrations`

We will also depreacte old versions (v1, v2, v3) of these APIs shortly and return only an error message.

### Added

* `POST /api/v4/registrant_reports` - create report
* `GET /api/v4/registrant_reports/<ID>` - check the status of a particular report and get the download URL
* `GET /api/v4/registrant_reports/<ID>/download` - download the contents of a registrant report in CSV format

* `POST /api/v4/gregistrant_reports` - create report
* `GET /api/v4/gregistrant_reports/<ID>` - check the status of a particular report and get the download URL
* `GET /api/v4/gregistrant_reports/<ID>/download` - download the contents of a registrant report in CSV format

## V3

Added these interfaces:

* `GET /api/v3/registrations/pdf_ready`
* `POST /api/v3/registrations/stop_reminders`
* `POST /api/v3/registrations/bulk`

In addition: 

* Added parameter for registration and gregistration to indicate async PDF generation or response blocking PDF generation.
* Added parameter for custom stop_reminders url. Added UID to the response.
* Modified format from `/api/v3/partners/partner.json` to `/api/v3/partners/[partner_id].json`
* Added `application/registration/partner` CSS urls, `finish_iframe_url`, `external_tracking_snippet`, `registration_instructions_url` to `/api/v3/partners/[partner_id].json` response.
* Added new fields to match column names for ActiveResource expectations and general standardization.

Modified request for:

* `GET /api/v3/partners/[partner_id].json`

to allow for all survey question languages.

## V2.2

Added these interfaces:

* `GET /api/v2/partnerpublicprofiles/partner.json`
* `GET /api/v2/gregistrationstates.json`
* `POST /api/v2/gregistration.json`
* `GET /api/v2/gregistrations.json`

Since this addition did not modify the existing API, did not rev from v2 to v3.

# Status Codes

All successful requests have response status code 200.

All requests with errors stemming from invalid or missing inputs have status code 400.

# Response Bodies

All response bodies are JSON dictionaries, with the key/value pairs described

# Interface Definitions

All requests and responses are JSON format. All fields are required unless otherwise specified as optional. All string fields have no length or format restrictions, unless specifically stated. Some field values have specific formats; others have parenthesized notations on field values.

## registrations

Creates a new registrant record using the input parameter data; and also triggers the side effects of a new record, e.g. sending confirmation email.

<h3 id="registration-fields">Fields</h3>

Most fields are personal information. A few fields merit additional description:

Field | Description
----- | -----------
partner_id | Uniquely identifies a partner organization that uses Rocky as a service for the organization’s members or community. Each transaction is logged by partner_id and every registrant record is tagged by partner_id.
source_tracking_id | Used to identify the source of a request. For example, in the Web UI, it is typically used as query parameter embedded in a URL in email messages, and identifies the request as part of a particular email campaign. The string value is un­interpreted, however, and may be used for any similar purpose
partner_tracking_id |  Similar to `source_tracking_id`, but intended for use for partner­ specific purposes, such as implementing a leader­board, that may require an a tag in addition to the source_tracking_id.
id_number | Typically a state driver’s license number state ID card number, or social security number; length and format vary by state, as does the explanation of what forms of ID are acceptable. However, id_number is not optional. (Note: it is true that some states’ localities will accept NVRA forms without an ID number, for the special case of people with neither state ID or an SSN. However, since we cannot record precisely how each state handles this special case, we require some ID number, to avoid creating registration requests that may be rejected.)
email_address | Required by default, even though it is optional for the paper form; however, we need it to contact the user to send them a link to the PDF we generate for them.
opt_in_email |  Determined by the caller, and simply recorded in the registration record created by the call; the caller can determine whether to always obtain the info from the user, or have a default in the case of no user input. Regardless, the opt_in_email field is required to record true or false for opt­ion, regardless of how the caller determined the user’s preference. This field is used to record a user preference for email from RockTheVote.
opt_in_sms | Required in exactly the same way as `opt_in_email`
opt_in_volunteer | Required in exactly the same way as `opt_in_email`
partner_opt_in_email, partner_opt_in_sms, partner_opt_in_volunteer | Used in an analogous way to record user preference for communication with the partner organization.
party |  Optional because it is not required on the form; however, the allowable values are state specific.
callback |  Optional parameter that, if present and not empty, changes the return value from JSON format to jsonp; that is, the JSON return value would be a string J, and if the callback parameter’s value is F, then the return value will be F(J);
custom_stop_reminders_url | Optional URL string that will be used in a link in reminder emails to registrants to cancel any further reminder emails. If the provided URL includes `<UID>`, that string will be replaced by the registrant’s UID. If left blank, the default core system stop_reminders URL will be used.
async | Specifies whether or not the request should return a response immediately (async=false) or wait for a PDF to be generated (async=true)

Other Notes

* Some fields are required in some states, optional in others, and not recorded in others; similarly some fields have permitted values that vary by state. State­ specific information is provided by other interfaces in this API.
* `pdfurl` is an out parameter that is the URL of a PDF file containing the voter registration application form with the personal information provided in the request.
  * The URL itself is a large number, large enough to make it very difficult for adversaries to guess URLs, for example https://register.rockthevote.org/pdf/456136972787234.pdf
  * One intended use is that the caller embed the URL in a link in dynamically generated HTML that is presented to the user.
  * The URL is returned regardless of whether the PDF is ready for download.

### Success

Field | Type | Notes
----- | ---- | -----
abandoned_registrations | integer | Number of records written


### Error Response

If any registrations can't be saved, status code 400 is returned, with a JSON list of responses for each record that is either an empty hash (`{}`) if there are no errors for that user, or a dictionary with `type`, `field_name` and `message` if there is an error

Field | Type | Notes

## gregistrations

Creates a new registrant record using the input parameter data, for the use case where the user was eligible to finish their registration on a government operated state­ specific web site, chose to be re­directed there, and did not return ­­ presumably because they finished registration on the state’s site.

Differs from registrations only in the following ways:

* Only the following parameters are required
  * lang
  * partner_id
  * send_confirmation_reminder_emails
  * date_of_birth
  * email_address
  * home_zip_code
  * us_citizen
  * name_title
  * last_name
* If `send_confirmation_reminder_emails` is true, then the emails sent are the the emails that are pertinent to this use case, rather than the standard use case of completing a registration using the Rocky UI
* The PDF is not generated, and therefore the `async` parameter has no effect
* Success has no output parameters
* There is an additional error return code

### HTTP Request

```json
{
  "registration": {
    "lang": "en",
    "partner_id": "123456789",
    "send_confirmation_reminder_emails": true,
    "date_of_birth": "01-01-1990",
    "email_address": "me@me.com",
    "home_zip_code": "01234",
    "us_citizen": true,
    "name_title": "Mrs.",
    "last_name": "Smith"
  }
}
```

`POST /api/v4/gregistrations.json`

Post a JSON object with key `registration` and value of a registration object

### Success

No body

### Errors

#### Unsupported state

Key | Value Type
--- | ---------
message | string

See [registrations interface definition errors](#registrations-errors) for other return data definitions.

## bulk_gregistrations

Same as gregistrations but expects an array of registrant records and returns the number of records created.

### Fields

[Registration interface definition fields](#registration-fields), plus these fields (all required):

Field | Type | Notes
----- | ---- | -----
status | string | Indicates a step number that the user stopped at
created_at | string | UTC datetime format
updated_at | string | UTC datetime format

### HTTP Request

`POST /api/v4/bulk_gregistrations.json`

Body is JSON dictionary with a single key, `bulk_gregistrations`, and value as a list of bulk registration dictionaries, as described above.

### Success Response

Body is a dictionary with key `bulk_gregistrations`, and the value is an integer with the number of records written, which should be the number of registrations posted.

> Success Response

```json
{
  "bulk_gregistrations": "integer (number of records written)"
}
```

### Error

If any registrations have an error, a status code 400 is returned, with a JSON list of responses for each record that is either an empty hash ({}) if there are no errors for that user, or a dictionary with `type`, `field_name` and `message` if there is an error

> Example object for a user with an error

```json
{
  "type": "string (ValidationError, SyntaxError, UnsupportedLanguageError)",
  "field_name": "string (field where error occurred)",
  "message": "string (determined by Rocky, for display by caller, in specified lang)"
}
```

## gregistrationstates

Returns a list of state for which Rocky current supports per­-state integration with states. There are no input parameters. State return data is the 2 letter code for the state, and the URL to use to send registrant data to the state’s web site.

### HTTP Request

`GET /api/v4/gregistrationstates.json`

### Response

Returns status code 200, with both of a dictionary with one key, `states`, which is a list of dictionaries with two keys: `name` which is the 2 letter state code, and `url` which is a string URL.

> Example response (truncated)

```json
{
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "AZ",
      "url": "https://servicearizona.com/webapp/evoter/selectLanguage"
    },
    {
      "name": "CA",
      "url": "https://covrtest.sos.ca.gov?language=LANGUAGE&t=p&CovrAgencyKey=AGENCY_KEY&PostingAgencyRecordId=TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

## state_requirements

Checks state eligibility and provides state­ specific fields information

Most input fields are personal information; most output fields are indicated as state specific. A few fields merit additional description:

* For input, one of `home_state_id` and `home_zip_code` is required. If both are provided, they must match. Really only one is needed.
* Fields named `<foo>_msg` contain a string with state­ specific information that explains the state­ specific situation of `<foo>`, such as what the requirements are for reporting race, or stating party affiliation, or why the state does not allow party affiliation, or what the state’s rules are about ID numbers for voter registration, or for minimum age for filing a voter registration application.
* Fields named `sos_<foo>` refer to the contract information for the office of Secretary of State for the state specified in the `home_state_id` input field
* Invalid state error is for a `home_state_id` input field value that is not a state, e.g. AJ
* Non-participating state error is for a correct state id, but for a state that does not participate in mail­in NVRA­ form registration; the explanatory msg is state­ specific
* To validate the age, make sure the person is 18+ yo and return localized error message if she’s not
* `no_party_msg` is the name of the last option for party affiliation; in some states it is "none" while in others it is "decline to state" and over time any state can change its preferences
* `requires_party_msg` explains the state’s rules for whether an application must or may include a party affiliation selection
* `callback` is an optional string parameter, exactly as described above
